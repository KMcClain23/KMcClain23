With a background in ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white), ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white), ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black), and ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=white), I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. I believe in the power of coding to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

I'm also a fan of ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black) and love building interactive user interfaces.

## 💼 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on. Each project has its own story, challenges, and lessons learned. Feel free to take a look:

1. [ECommerceMUI](https://github.com/KMcClain23/ecommerceMUI): I really enjoyed utilizing strapi as it simplified the backend process. This was also the first time I utilized stripe for payments and I will definitely use it again. :)

2. [AdminDashMUI](https://github.com/KMcClain23/reactAdminMaterialUI): This was my first project using MUI and it was great! One of my fun challenges was determining the theme and colorscheme to look juuuuust right.

3. [FamilyMeals](https://github.com/KMcClain23/newCapRecipe): This is a project I started for the betterment of my family and to keep the family recipe legacy alive. Halfway through I became very excited about all of the future features that would help the user stay connected with their family.

## 🌱 Currently...

Last Minute Grocery Texts - 
I'm currently working on passion projects for the common person. Ever get that last minute text asking if you've left the grocery store yet? Of course I already left. I'm efficient! :) Well, get that text no more by sending an automated message before you leave to make certain there's nothing else to get.

It's always exciting to keep pushing my boundaries and expanding my skillset. If you're interested in solving every day problems with code, let's connect and share our insights and ideas!
