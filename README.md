## 🧐 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves to create, innovate, and collaborate. With a background in ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/-HTML5-E34F26?logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-1572B6?logo=css3&logoColor=white), ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white), ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-F7DF1E?logo=javascript&logoColor=black), and ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/-TypeScript-3178C6?logo=typescript&logoColor=white), I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. I believe in the power of coding to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact.

I'm also a fan of ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React-61DAFB?logo=react&logoColor=black) and love building interactive user interfaces.

## 🌱 Currently...

Last Minute Grocery Texts - 
I'm currently working on passion projects for the common person. Ever get that last minute text asking if you've left the grocery store yet? Of course I have. I'm efficient! :) Well, get that text no more by sending an automated message before you leave to make certain there's nothing else to get.

It's always exciting to keep pushing my boundaries and expanding my skillset. If you're interested in solving everday problems with code, let's connect and share our insights and ideas!
